# Demo Game 

This is demo app to give an idea of the kinds of code and programming involved with programming web applications. 

View the game live [here](https://make-school-labs.github.io/few-track-demo/). 

# Instructions
1. Let's start in the `index.html` file
   1. Find the `title` tag, and change it from `demo game` to something fun
   2. Find the `h1` tag that holds our `boring game title`, and update it with a new fun and exciting name
   3. Find the `link` to our stylesheet and add in the `href` attribute
   4. Take a look at whats changed on the page
2. Now over to the `style.css` file
   1. Look through the images folder and find a cool alien you want to play as
   2. In the `:root` rule, change the `--player-image` variable to the your favorite alien
   3. Lets also change the `--background-image` to your favorite wall
   4. Now lets change the `--button-color` to something more readable
   5. The buttons look better, but them being square is a little weird, so lets find the `.button` rule
   6. inside the `.button` rule, lets add a new property `border-radius` and set it to a value of `50%`
3. Now the page looks a lot better, lets make it work
   1. Go back to the `index.html` file and find the `script` tag, add in the `src` attribute
   2. Take a look at whats going on, things are moving now!
   3. Find the `timePerBomb` and `timePerFruit` variable and change them until you find a ballance you like.
   4. Find the `makeObject` function, and inside find where the objects speeds are set.
   5. change the speed of the bombs and fruits until you find a ballance you like
4. Looks good!

## Todo - 

1. Some tasks to explore programming on the web.
  - Include comments with notes on possible values along side code
  - Building Web Applications 
    - Need a branch to demo the completed game 
    - Master branch should leave out some things that become and activity
      - Links to css files and js files
        - These files might be broken into separate files 
  - HTML 
    - Add some images of other characters
    - Add CSS styles 
    - Add JS file 
  - CSS 
    - Can be better organized for demo
    - Add opportunities for students to make improvements to the appearance 
      - #container overflow hidden 
      - #contanier round corner
      - .button round corner changes colors
      - .button:hover change colors 
      - add a box shadow to player
    - Change game images used as game elements 
      - --player-image
      - --bg-image
      - --bomb-image
      - --fruit-*
  - JS 
    - Add link to main.js
    - Change somethings in the JS to see what happens
      - Edit variables 
        - change the speed and frequency of elements 
          - speed of bombs and fruit
          - frequency of fruit vs bombs
